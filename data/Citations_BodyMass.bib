@article{Cai:2025aa,
	abstract = {Increasing species richness toward the equator has been hypothesized to result from elevated temperatures, which increase molecular rates and consequently facilitate rapid speciation. We tested this hypothesis using 5,424 mitochondrial and 1,512 nuclear genomes of vertebrates to explore latitudinal patterns in molecular rates and their relationships with species diversification. Our findings reveal that neutral molecular rates increase with temperature in ectotherms but not in endotherms, reflecting distinct key predictors between thermogroups. Nonneutral mitochondrial rates increase with temperature across vertebrates, but mitochondrial molecular rates do not correlate with species diversification. Nuclear molecular rates support this hypothesis in reptiles and amphibians but not in mammals, birds, or fishes. Our findings suggest that factors beyond molecular rates drive global biodiversity patterns across vertebrates. The latitudinal diversity gradient (LDG) is the most notable global biodiversity pattern, but its underlying mechanisms remain unresolved. The evolutionary speed hypothesis (ESH) posits that molecular rates play a crucial role in shaping the LDG, suggesting that higher temperatures accelerate molecular rates, thereby facilitating rapid speciation and accumulation of biodiversity in the tropics. However, whether ESH can explain the LDG across diverse taxonomic groups remains debated, and systematic examinations of its two key predictions using consistent datasets and methodologies across vertebrates are lacking. Here, we tested ESH using molecular rates from mitochondrial (5,424 species) and nuclear (1,512 species) genomes across major vertebrate groups, including fishes, amphibians, reptiles, mammals, and birds. Our findings revealed distinct latitudinal patterns in the absolute synonymous substitution rate (dS), which were influenced by thermoregulatory strategies. Specifically, the dS increases with ambient temperature and decreases with latitude in ectotherms but shows no correlation in most endotherms. These distinct patterns are likely attributed to different key predictors of dS between thermogroups, with temperature playing a major role only in ectotherms. For mitochondrial genes, absolute nonsynonymous substitution rates (dN) increase with temperature, likely driven by mutation rates in ectotherms and purifying selection in endotherms. However, neither mitochondrial dS nor dN correlates with diversification rates across vertebrates, contradicting the second prediction of ESH. For nuclear rates, the ESH was supported in reptiles and amphibians but not in mammals, birds, or fishes. In conclusion, our results provide limited support for ESH in vertebrates, underscoring the intricate processes that shape the LDG.},

	abstract = {Current ecological and evolutionary research are increasingly moving from species- to trait-based approaches because traits provide a stronger link to organism's function and fitness. Trait databases covering a large number of species are becoming available, but such data remains scarce for certain groups. Amphibians are among the most diverse vertebrate groups on Earth, and constitute an abundant component of major terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems. They are also facing rapid population declines worldwide, which is likely to affect trait composition in local communities, thereby impacting ecosystem processes and services. In this context, we introduce AmphiBIO, a comprehensive database of natural history traits for amphibians worldwide. The database releases information on 17 traits related to ecology, morphology and reproduction features of amphibians. We compiled data from more than 1,500 literature sources, and for more than 6,500 species of all orders (Anura, Caudata and Gymnophiona), 61 families and 531 genera. This database has the potential to allow unprecedented large-scale analyses in ecology, evolution, and conservation of amphibians.},

@article{Smith:2003aa,
	abstract = {The purpose of this data set was to compile body mass information for all mammals on Earth so that we could investigate the patterns of body mass seen across geographic and taxonomic space and evolutionary time. We were interested in the heritability of body size across taxonomic groups (How conserved is body mass within a genus, family, and order?), in the overall pattern of body mass across continents (Do the moments and other descriptive statistics remain the same across geographic space?), and over evolutionary time (How quickly did body mass patterns iterate on the patterns seen today? Were the Pleistocene extinctions size specific on each continent, and did these events coincide with the arrival of man?). These data are also part of a larger project that seeks to integrate body mass patterns across very diverse taxa (NCEAS Working Group on Body Size in Ecology and Paleoecology: linking pattern and process across space, time, and taxonomic scales). We began with the updated version of D. E. Wilson and D. M. Reeder's taxonomic list of all known Recent mammals of the world (N = 4629 species) to which we added status, distribution, and body mass estimates compiled from the primary and secondary literature. Whenever possible, we used an average of male and female body mass, which was in turn averaged over multiple localities to arrive at our species body mass values. The sources are line referenced in the main data set, with the actual references appearing in a table within the metadata. Mammals have individual records for each continent they occur on. Note that our data set is more than an amalgamation of smaller compilations. Although we relied heavily on a data set for Chiroptera by K. E. Jones (N = 905), the CRC handbook of Mammalian Body Mass (N = 688), and a data set compiled for South America by P. Marquet (N = 505), these represent less than half the records in the current database. The remainder are derived from more than 150 other sources. Furthermore, we include a comprehensive late Pleistocene species assemblage for Africa, North and South America, and Australia (an additional 230 species). ``Late Pleistocene'' is defined as approximately 11 ka for Africa, North and South America, and as 50 ka for Australia, because these times predate anthropogenic impacts on mammalian fauna. Estimates contained within this data set represent a generalized species value, averaged across sexes and geographic space. Consequently, these data are not appropriate for asking population-level questions where the integration of body mass with specific environmental conditions is important. All extant orders of mammals are included, as well as several archaic groups (N = 4859 species). Because some species are found on more than one continent (particularly Chiroptera), there are 5731 entries. We have body masses for the following: Artiodactyla (280 records), Bibymalagasia (2 records), Carnivora (393 records), Cetacea (75 records), Chiroptera (1071 records), Dasyuromorphia (67 records), Dermoptera (3 records), Didelphimorphia (68 records), Diprotodontia (127 records), Hydracoidea (5 records), Insectivora (234 records), Lagomorpha (53 records), Litopterna (2 records), Macroscelidea (14 records), Microbiotheria (1 record), Monotremata (7 records), Notoryctemorphia (1 record), Notoungulata (5 records), Paucituberculata (5 records), Peramelemorphia (24 records), Perissodactyla (47 records), Pholidota (8 records), Primates (276 records), Proboscidea (14 records), Rodentia (1425 records), Scandentia (15 records), Sirenia (6 records), Tubulidentata (1 record), and Xenarthra (75 records).},

In particular, estimates are provided for the LWR parameters a and b in general as well as by body shape. These priors and existing LWR studies were used to derive species-specific LWR parameters. In the case of data-poor species, the analysis includes LWR studies of closely related species with the same body shape. This approach yielded LWR parameter estimates with measures of uncertainty for practically all known 32 000 species of fishes. Provided is a large LWR data set extracted from www.fishbase.org, the source code of the respective analyses, and ready-to-use tools for practitioners. This is presented as an example of a self-learning online database where the addition of new studies improves the species-specific parameter estimates, and where these parameter estimates inform the analysis of new data.},

Oyster drill prey selection was assessed in terms of prey (oyster) size and shell thickness. Drills fed on oysters with thinner shells 86% of the time and selectively preyed on smaller (1g wet weight) oysters during colder months and larger (10g wet weight) oysters during warmer months. Analysis of U. cinerea seasonal feeding patterns showed virtually no feeding during winter months (January to March) and a significant increase to over 1 gram of prey tissue per week during summer (July to September). A nine month experiment compared feeding rates of U. cinerea at two different temperature levels: ambient seawater (control) and temperatures elevated 4$\,^{\circ}$C above ambient. Oyster drills showed a 60% increase in feeding rate in the warmer treatment, especially during late summer, fall and early winter. Both temperature manipulation and annual feeding experiments revealed a significant temperature dependence of U. cinerea feeding rates. Seasonal or long-term seawater temperature changes related to climate change could strongly affect the predator--prey relationship between U. cinerea and its prey.},
