## Contributing Guide

How to set up, code, test, review, and release so contributions meet our Definition of Done.

## Code of Conduct

All project interactions should allign with the guidelines described in the Oregon State Univesiry Code of Student Conduct: https://studentlife.oregonstate.edu/sites/studentlife.oregonstate.edu/files/student-conduct-community-standards/Code/code_of_conduct_comp.pdf

## Getting Started

List prerequisites, setup steps, environment variables/secrets handling, and how to run the app locally.

In order to use our application, there are no prerequisite installations or set-up steps. The site is hosted publically at: https://praterh.github.io/HaileysTaxonBodyMassML/web_dev/index.html

## Branching & Workflow

Describe the workflow (e.g., trunk-based or GitFlow), default branch, branch naming, and when to rebase vs. merge. (Work in progress)

## Issues & Planning

Explain how to file issues, required templates/labels, estimation, and triage/assignment practices. (Work in progress)

We will use GitHub Issues

## Commit Messages

We will use Conventional Commits, which follow the template: type(scope): description

Examples:
- docs(contributing): completed the commit messages section in contributing.md
- feat(data): log transformed the species mass data
- feat(ui): included histograms on data visualization tab

Reference issues by including either "Fixes #xyz" or "Refs #xyz" at the end of a commit.

## Code Style, Linting & Formatting

Name the formatter/linter, config file locations, and the exact commands to check/fix locally. (Work in progress)

## Testing

Define required test types, how to run tests, expected coverage thresholds, and when new/updated tests are mandatory.

Unit Tests: HTTP GET returns status 200 OK, model returns correct structure response upon query
Performance Test: 1 query takes less than 1 minute
Security Scan: API type-checking verification, no .env files are included in the commit/PR

These tests run automatically upon any commit or Pull Request.  Any time an independent feature is added to the main branch, a corresponding unit test should be added to the testing framework. 

## Pull Requests & Reviews

Outline PR requirements (template, checklist, size limits), reviewer expectations, approval rules, and required status checks.

The PR template and checklist can be found in .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md

## CI/CD

Link to pipeline definitions, list mandatory jobs, how to view logs/re-run jobs, and what must pass before merge/release.

Located in ./github/workflows and triggers after every push or PR to the main branch

## Security & Secrets

State how to report vulnerabilities, prohibited patterns (hard-coded secrets), dependency update policy, and scanning tools.  (Work in progress)

## Documentation Expectations

Specify what must be updated (README, docs/, API refs, CHANGELOG) and docstring/comment standards.  (Work in progress)

## Release Process

Describe versioning scheme, tagging, changelog generation, packaging/publishing steps, and rollback process.  (Work in progress)
 
Each version will be automatically named with an iterating version number after the decimal point.  All pre-release versions will be formatted as 0.X.  All release versions will be formatted as 1.X.  

## Support & Contact

Provide maintainer contact channel, expected response windows, and where to ask questions. (Work in progress)

The best contact channel will be Mark Novak: mark.novak@oregonstate.edu
