    <p> 1. I am a student writing a paper for my zoology class about a deep-sea organism; there are no known body mass records for the organism. I stumble across the TaxonBodyMassML website while searching the web for body mass information. I click the 'x' in the upper right-hand corner of the box welcoming me to the website to close it. I click on the input bar that reads "Input species name(s)..." and type in the scientific name of the deep-sea species. The "single" option appears to already be selected, so I click the button that says "Go!". I watch as the output box appears, at first saying "Checking species name...", then reading "Species not found". I realize I made a typo when typing in the species name, so I click on the input bar again, which is still populated with the incorrectly-typed scientific name, fix my mistake, and press the "Go Again!" button. This time, the output box contains a number which is labeled "mass". I am curious about how the website came up with this number, so I click the "Learn More?" button under the mass output and learn about the algorithm and predictive process. When I include this information in my zoology paper, I make sure to say that this is a projected mass, and cite the website I used.</p>
